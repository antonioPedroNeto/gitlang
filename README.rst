List of all languages supported by `github.com`_ as of Feb 26 2017 6:00 PM PST.

Why was this list created ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I looked around for such a list and did not find one which does nothing but list
all the languages that github supports, so I created one by scraping off the
languages from github's `trending`_ page, ``Other: Languages`` button.

Why is a repo created for the list ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So that if someone else needs it now or in future, they need not go through
creating a list of their own.
